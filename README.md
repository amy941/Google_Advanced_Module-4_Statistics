# OVERVIEW:
Little did I know that Statistics is the backbone in data 😅 In this end-of-course project, I tackled 3 different case studies using Python and basic Stats to solve:
- Case Study 1: Automatidata, a fictional data consulting firm
- Case Study 2: TikTok, a short-form video hosting firm
- Case Study 3: Waze, a driving directions app

1) Goal: to develop an app that enables NY Taxi and Limo Commission (TLC) riders to estimate the taxi fares in advance.
2) Scenario: The data team was assigned to analyze the relationship between fare amounts and payment type. Hypothesis test was conducted in this dataset.
3) To-do:
- Compute descriptive stats
- Conduct a Hypothesis test
- Create an executive summary for the stakeholders
4)
