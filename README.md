# OVERVIEW:
Little did I know that Statistics is the backbone in data 😅 In this end-of-course project, I tackled 3 different case studies using Python and basic Stats to solve:
- *Case Study 1:* **Automatidata,** a fictional data consulting firm
- *Case Study 2:* **TikTok,** a short-form video hosting firm
- *Case Study 3:* **Waze,** a driving directions app

# Case Study 1: Automatidata 🔎

**1) Goal:** to develop an app that enables NY Taxi and Limo Commission (TLC) riders to estimate the taxi fares in advance.

**2) Scenario:** The data team was assigned to analyze the relationship between fare amounts and payment type. Hypothesis test was conducted in this dataset.

**3) To-do:**
- Compute descriptive stats
- Conduct a Hypothesis test
- Create an executive summary for the stakeholders
  
**4) The Analysis:**

# Closing Thoughts:
Statistics is tough 🙃 It took me over a month to get the hang of the basics (very basic). Regardless, I think I'm in a better place than I was last month 🐌🐌🐌
