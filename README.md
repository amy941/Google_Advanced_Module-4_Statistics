# OVERVIEW:
Little did I know that Statistics is the backbone in data 😅 In this end-of-course project, I tackled 3 different case studies using Python and basic Stats to solve:
- *Case Study 1:* **Automatidata,** a fictional data consulting firm
- *Case Study 2:* **TikTok,** a short-form video hosting firm
- *Case Study 3:* **Waze,** a driving directions app

# Tools I used:
**Python, GitHub**

# Closing Thoughts:
Statistics is tough 🙃 It took me over a month to get the hang of the basics (very basic). Regardless, I think I'm in a better place than I was last month 🐌🐌🐌
