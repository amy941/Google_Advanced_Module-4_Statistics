# OVERVIEW:
Little did I know that Statistics is the backbone in data 😅 In this end-of-course project, I tackled 2 different case studies using Python and basic Stats to solve:
- *Case Study 1:* **Automatidata,** a fictional data consulting firm
- *Case Study 2:* **TikTok,** a short-form video hosting firm

## What I Learned:
  
  **1) Compute a descriptive stats:**
     First, take a glimpse at the big data to understand how the dataset is structured before proceeding. The following functions are used: 
     **pandas:** .describe(), .head(), .shape 
     **numpy:** .mean()
     
     ```python
     taxi_data.describe(include='all')
     ```
     
  
 

  **2) Conduct Hypothesis test and A/B test:**

  
  **3) Provide insights to stakeholders:**

# Closing Thoughts:
Statistics is tough 🙃 It took me over a month to get the hang of the basics (very basic). Regardless, I think I'm in a better place than I was last month 🐌🐌🐌
