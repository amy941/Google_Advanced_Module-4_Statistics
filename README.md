# OVERVIEW:
Little did I know that Statistics is the backbone in data 😅 In this end-of-course project, I tackled 2 different case studies using Python and basic Stats to solve:
- *Case Study 1:* **Automatidata,** a fictional data consulting firm
- *Case Study 2:* **TikTok,** a short-form video hosting firm

## What I Learned:
  
  **1) Compute a descriptive stats:**
     First, take a glimpse at the big data to understand how the dataset is structured before proceeding. The following functions are used:
  
     **pandas:** .describe(), .head(), .shape | 
     **numpy:** .mean()
     
     ``` python
     taxi_data.describe(include='all')
     ```
     ![describe()](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b3dcf70-2f0c-41a5-9a3a-80af6de01a19)
  
     ✍ *.describe()* generates the table with basic descriptive stats: mean, std deviation, min/max, interquartile, etc.

     ```python
     taxi_data.groupby('payment_type')['fare_amount'].mean()
     ```
     ✍ Use *.groupby()* to compute the mean value of fare_amount(price) for each group of payment_type (credit card, cash,...) in the sample data, then calc. average fare amount for each group of payment types.

     ![avg mean](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c9d15bb-1da5-43a8-816d-22337b4468da)

     ✍ *(1: Credit card, 2: Cash, 3: No charge, 4: Dispute, 5: Unknown)*
  
  Payment_type: 1-Credit card and 2-Cash. **The table shows credit card users tend to pay more than cash users**, $13.4 and $12.2, respectively.
     

  **2) Conduct Hypothesis test and A/B test:**

  
  **3) Provide insights to stakeholders:**

# Closing Thoughts:
Statistics is tough 🙃 It took me over a month to get the hang of the basics (very basic). Regardless, I think I'm in a better place than I was last month 🐌🐌🐌
