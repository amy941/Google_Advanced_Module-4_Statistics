# OVERVIEW:
Little did I know that Statistics is the backbone in data 😅 In this end-of-course project, I tackled 2 different case studies using Python and basic Stats to solve:
- *Case Study 1:* **Automatidata,** a fictional data consulting firm
- *Case Study 2:* **TikTok,** a short-form video hosting firm

# Case Study 1: Automatidata 🚕

- Analysis and Insights:
  1) Compute a descriptive stats:
     Use .head(), .describe(), to take a glimpse at the big data and see what it give us.
     ``` python
     taxi_data.describe(include='all')
     ```
  3) Conduct Hypothesis test and A/B test:
  4) Provide insights to stakeholders:

# Tools I used:
**Python, GitHub**

# Closing Thoughts:
Statistics is tough 🙃 It took me over a month to get the hang of the basics (very basic). Regardless, I think I'm in a better place than I was last month 🐌🐌🐌
